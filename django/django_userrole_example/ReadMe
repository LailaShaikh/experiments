How to run this example?


navigate to the project directory in shell

  `python manange.py runserver`

we are using sqlite db. No need to configure anything


test url:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/

if you login through super user which is accessbile

if you login as customer role which could not access this url

BTW, we haven't implemented any login system. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
we can manually replace the url to `/home/` instead of `/admin/`

role: customer
username: customer
password: customer

role: admin
username: a
password: a
